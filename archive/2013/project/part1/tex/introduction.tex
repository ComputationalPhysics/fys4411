\subsection*{Part a, Variational Monte Carlo studies of atoms}

The final aim of this project is to develop a variational Monte Carlo program which can be used to obtain ground state properties of atoms like He, Be, O, Ne, Si etc. If possible (time allowing) the hope is to be to be able to perform calculations for important molecules.

The aim of the part (a) of this  project is to use the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method and evaluate the ground state energy of the helium, beryllium and neon atoms. Although we confine ourselves to atoms and molecules, you should however make your code flexible enough to run for two-dimensional systems like electrons confined in quantum dots or other fermionic systems in one, two and three dimensions.

We expect to finalize this part on March 22. Only a short report and a link to your Git repository is required.
