The files included in the folder ./src can be used for generating random numbers with a normal distribution, with variance equal to 1. 
To use the random number generator, proceed as follows:

1.) Download the files and save them in a convenient directory.
2.) Include the files with '#include ...'
3.) Before you use the random number generator for the first time, initialize it with

	RanNormalSetSeedZigVec(&seed, 100);

The variable 'seed' must be an integer. The second integer does not have much to say, just do not(!) set it to 256.

4.) Each time you need a random number, call

	int myRandomNumber = DRanNormalZigVec();
